- remove patch_idx from main model

string editor:
- add a explanatory label for the drawing (e.g. tell the user to click onto a module in the map after clicking "start drawing")

defect anotation:
- show tooltip with module defects on hover

- use pretrained ResNet for defect analysis

status bar
- show track ID, plant ID of selected module
- show string ID of selected string
- display currently opened dataset path
- display number of patches of the selected module
- display string info: number of modules, number of defects, etc.


sun reflection filter:
- move from vision pipeline into dataset viewer as an analysis method (highlight patches in patch overview with a frame depending on result of sun reflection filter)
- make a checkbox in module temperature analysis to ignore patches with sun reflections (if sun reflections are available)
