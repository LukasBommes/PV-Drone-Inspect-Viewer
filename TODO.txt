- improve enabling/disabling of buttons to ensure a better user guidance through the string annotation process
- only enable "conform string" button after user has finished drawing the string
- make a "lifting pen" function to allow drawing strings that are spatially seperated

defect anotation:
- show tooltip with module defects on hover

analysis:
- use pretrained ResNet for defect analysis

map controls:
- colormap selection

status bar
- show track ID, plant ID of selected module
- show string ID of selected string
- display currently opened dataset path
- display number of patches of the selected module
- display string info: number of modules, number of defects, etc.
