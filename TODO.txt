general:
- make a settings for which patch to select (e.g. max temp patch, first patch, user selected patch, ...)

defect anotation:
- show tooltip with module defects on hover

analysis:
- use pretrained ResNet for defect analysis

status bar
- show track ID, plant ID of selected module
- show string ID of selected string
- display currently opened dataset path
- display number of patches of the selected module
- display string info: number of modules, number of defects, etc.


sun reflection filter:
- move from vision pipeline into dataset viewer as an analysis method (highlight patches in patch overview with a frame depending on result of sun reflection filter)
- make a checkbox in module temperature analysis to ignore patches with sun reflections (if sun reflections are available)
