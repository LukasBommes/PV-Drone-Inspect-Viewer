# Dataset Viewer for PV Drone Inspect

This is an open-source desktop app for viewing and analyzing maps of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) plants created with [PV Drone Inspect](https://github.com/LukasBommes/PV-Drone-Inspect).

The following functionality is provided in this app:
- View the reconstruction of your PV plant created with PV Drone Inspect
- Browse individual PV modules and video frames
- Perform analyses (e.g. PV module defect detection)
- Overlay analysis results on the map
- Annotate PV module defects
- Annotate electrcial connectivity of modules (strings)

## Installation

We provide prebuild binaries for Ubuntu (x86_64). Download the zip archive from [here]() and extract it to the desired location. Start the terminal in the extracted archive and run the dataset viewer with
```
./main
```

If you want to use the dataset viewer on Windows or you have a different Linux distribution, please see the [instructions below](#build-from-source) on how to build the app from source code.

## Quickstart

After startup the app shows an empty map.

![screenshot app started](docs/screenshots/screenshot_app_started.png)

### Opening a dataset

First, you have to open a PV Drone Inspect dataset by clicking *File -> Open Dataset...* (An example dataset can be dowbloaded from [here]()). When the dataset is loaded correctly the map updates and shows a map of the PV plant. You can click individual PV modules and the app will retrieve all image patches of that module as well as the video frame of which the first patch was extracted.

### Performing an analysis on the data

The app provides some analyses that can be performed on the dataset. To this end, click *Analysis -> New Analysis...* The window below will open. Here, you can select which analysis to perform. You can set the hyper parameters and run the analysis by clicking *Compute*. See [below](#details-on-analyses) for details on the available analyses.

![screenshot analysis](docs/screenshots/screenshot_analysis.png)

Once the analysis is completed, you will find an entry in the *Data Sources* list. When you click on this entry, the map will update and show the analysis results, e.g. temperatures of the PV modules as shown below. 

Results are stored for each analysis under `<path to the opened dataset>/analyses/<name of the analysis>`.

### Annotating module defects

You can use the dataset viewer to manually annotate each PV module with one or multiple defect classes. To this end, click *Annotation -> New Defect Annotation...* An additional *Annotation Editor* list will become visible.

To label a module click onto the module in the map and then check the checkboxes with the corresponding defect class(es) in the *Annotation Editor*. You can save the annotation via *Annotation -> Save Defect Annotation*

You may also provide your own annotation scheme by editing the existing scheme in `src/resources/defect_schema.json`.

### Annotationing electrical connectivity

The dataset viewer finally allows you to annotate the electrical connectivity of the individual PV modules. To do so, click on *Annotation -> Annotate Strings...* An additional *String Editor* widget will become visible. 

To enter a new string click *New String...* in the string editor. Now, you will have to draw lines into the map which connect all modules within a string. For this, click the *Start button* and on the map click on the first module in the string. If your string is a simple line you can click onto the last module on the map and then hit the *End* button to stop drawing. All modules intersecting the line will be assigned to that string.

If your string is not a simple line, you have to draw multiple line segments. Instead of clicking only the first and last module in a string, click on those intermediate modules where you want to start a new line segment.

If you encouter a situation where a string contains modules at different (far apart) locations in the plant, you can click the *Pause* button while drawing the line segments. This allows you to draw a line segment which does not include intersecting modules in the string.

After hitting the *End* button provide the Tracker ID, Array ID, Inverter ID and String ID and hit *Confirm String*. This will assign a unique ID to each module which looks as follows `<Tracker ID>_<Array_ID>_<Inverter ID>_<String_ID>_<Module ID>`. The module ID is automatically created based on the location of the module along the line that you drew ealier.

You can export the string annotation for further use by clicking *Annotation -> Export String Annotation...*

## Installation from Source

Install prerequisites
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [QT](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)

Use Python pip to install the following packages

- [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/)
- ...

Clone the repository by running

```
git clone https://github.com/LukasBommes/PV-Drone-Inspect
```

Now, start a terminal in the root directory of the repository and run the dataset viewer
```
python main.py
```

## Build binaries for other platforms

If you want to provide binaries for other platforms, such as Windows make sure the dataset viewer can be run on your target platform as described in [Installtion from Source](#installation-from-source).

Install [cx_Freeze](https://pypi.org/project/cx-Freeze/) with Python pip and freeze the dataset viewer by running
```
python setup.py build
```
This will create a `build` directory containing the binary for your platform, which you can run as
```
./main
```
Important: You have to perform this procedure on the platform you want to build the binary for, e.g. run this on Windows to make a Windows executable.

## Details on analyses

As mentioned above the dataset viewer allows you to perform some analyses on the PV Drone Inspect dataset. We will explain those in more detail here.
